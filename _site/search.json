    "text": "This is a distributional map of shysharks around the coast of Southern Africa. Shysharks are an endemic, benthic genus of sharks found along the coast of Southern African. Though there are four shyshark species, I’ve focused on two (the Puffadder shyshark or Happy Eddy - Haploblepharus edwardsii - and the Dark shyshark - H. pictus) as the Brown shyshark (H. fuscus) and Natal shyshark (H. kistnasamyi) are rather cryptic and there are only a few observations of them on iNaturalist (where I got my data).\nFirst we start by clearing our work space.\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\nTo run the code you will need the packages tidyverse, sp, sf, raster, lwgeom, terra, stars, exactextractr, hrbrthemes,cowplot, rinat, prettymapr, ggspatial, leaflet, mapview, htmltools, leafpop, rnaturalearth, and rnaturalearthdata.\n\nmy_packages &lt;- c(\"tidyverse\", \"sp\", \"sf\", \"raster\", \"lwgeom\", \"terra\", \"stars\", \"exactextractr\", \"hrbrthemes\",\"cowplot\", \"rinat\", \"prettymapr\", \"ggspatial\", \"leaflet\", \"mapview\", \"htmltools\", \"leafpop\", \"rnaturalearth\", \"rnaturalearthdata\") \nlapply(my_packages, require, character.only = TRUE)\n\nNow we’re going to get the data from iNaturalist (using the “rinat” package), and name the dataframes “puffyshark” for the Happy Eddies and “darkshark” for the dark shysharks.\n\npuffyshark &lt;- get_inat_obs(taxon_name = \"Haploblepharus edwardsii\", maxresults = 600) \n\ndarkshark &lt;- get_inat_obs(taxon_name = \"Haploblepharus pictus\", maxresults = 600)\n\nTo exclude observations in the northern hemisphere, observations with low positional accuracy, latitude values that are NA, and non research grade observations we use the filter function (tidyverse).\n\npuffyshark &lt;- puffyshark %&gt;% filter(positional_accuracy &lt; 100 & latitude &lt;0 & !is.na(latitude) & quality_grade == \"research\")\n\ndarkshark &lt;- darkshark %&gt;% filter(positional_accuracy &lt; 100 & latitude &lt;0 & !is.na(latitude) & quality_grade == \"research\")\n\nIn order to actually plot these data we need to make the dataframes spatial objects of the class “sf”.\n\npuffyshark &lt;- st_as_sf(puffyshark, coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326) \n\ndarkshark &lt;- st_as_sf(darkshark, coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\nIf we want to avoid a whole lot a pain in the future (generally a good habit to create when working with GIS) we need to check the class and coordinate reference system (CRS) of our dataframes\n\nclass(puffyshark)\nclass(darkshark)\n\nst_crs(puffyshark)\nst_crs(darkshark) \n\nNice!! All systems go!\nBut wait! There’s some more filtering that needs to happen - we want to exclude all observations of sharks that were made on land (shoutout to ChatGPT for the help).\nWe start by creating a dataframe for the land surface and checking that the CRS matches our other dataframes’ CRS.\n\nworld_land &lt;- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\", country = \"south africa\")\n\nst_crs(world_land)\n\nNext we need to spatially join this dataframe to ID the shark observations on land and create new dataframes without those observations.\n\nlandsharks_ps &lt;- st_join(puffyshark, world_land, join = st_disjoint) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(iso_a2))\noceanshark_ps &lt;- puffyshark[puffyshark$geometry %in% landsharks_ps$geometry,] \n\nlandsharks_ds &lt;- st_join(darkshark, world_land, join = st_disjoint) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(iso_a2))\noceanshark_ds &lt;- darkshark[darkshark$geometry %in% landsharks_ds$geometry,]\n\nLet’s see if that worked by plotting these data.\n\nggplot() + \n  annotation_map_tile(type = \"osm\", progress = \"none\") + \n  geom_sf(data = oceanshark_ps, color = \"#85B22C\")\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  annotation_map_tile(type = \"osm\", progress = \"none\") + \n  geom_sf(data = oceanshark_ds, color = \"#422CB2\")\n\n\n\n\nHmm. It would be more helpful if both species were on one map…\n\nggplot() + \n  annotation_map_tile(type = \"osm\", progress = \"none\") + \n  geom_sf(data = oceanshark_ps, color = \"#85B22C\") + \n  geom_sf(data = oceanshark_ds, color = \"#422CB2\")\n\n\n\n\nThat’s better!\nNow the fun part - creating interactive maps with both species (with the leaflet package)!\n\nleaflet() %&gt;% \n  addTiles(group = \"Default\") %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(data = oceanshark_ps, \n                   group = \"Haploblepharus edwardsii\", \n                   radius = 1, \n                   color = \"#85B22C\")%&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(data = oceanshark_ds, \n                   group = \"Haploblepharus pictus\", \n                   radius = 1, \n                   color = \"#422CB2\")%&gt;% \n  addLegend(position = \"topright\", \n            colors = c(\"#85B22C\", \"#422CB2\"), \n            labels = c(\"Puffadder shyshark\", \"Dark shyshark\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try a different package - mapview - to create an interactive map with a popup for each data point that gives a link to that point’s iNaturalist observation.\nFirst thing’s first - let’s make the links possible (thank you Jasper Slingsby for making this particular skulduggery possible).\n\nloceanshark_ps &lt;- oceanshark_ps %&gt;%\n  mutate(click_url = paste(\"&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href='\", url, \"'&gt;Link to iNat observation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\"))\n\nloceanshark_ds &lt;- oceanshark_ds %&gt;%\n  mutate(click_url = paste(\"&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href='\", url, \"'&gt;Link to iNat observation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\"))\n\nFinally - let’s create an interactive map with links to iNaturalist observations!\n\nmapview(oceanshark_ps, col.regions = \"#85B22C\", layer.name = \"Puffadder shyshark\", legend = TRUE,\n        popup = \n          popupTable(loceanshark_ps,\n                     zcol = c(\"user_login\", \"click_url\", \"id\"))) + \nmapview(oceanshark_ds, col.regions = \"#422CB2\", layer.name = \"Dark shyshark\", legend = TRUE,\n        popup = \n          popupTable(loceanshark_ds, \n                     zcol = c(\"user_login\", \"click_url\", \"id\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnywho - thank you for sticking with me through this! As a reward here’s a little picture of a shyshark I took a while back.\n\nHappy Eddy - ‘Haploblepharus edwardsii’ - photographed at Windmill Beach, Cape Town.\nOkay - SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH!!\nThank you Jasper Slingsby for providing the base code for this.

It’s easy to realise our insignificance when facing a gentle giant. I am interested in whale and shark behaviour, communication, distribution, and genetics. I am obsessed with how climate change is altering nature and how nature is evolving because of it. I am interested in humans and how they interact with the world around them.\nFor now this website will be dedicated to getting better at coding in R. So it’ll likely be code and some GIS visuals for projects. Hopefully a link to a publication sometime next year."

    "title": "Silent Earth: Averting the Insect Apocalypse - Dave Goulson",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Silent Earth is a compelling and urgent call to action. In it, biologist Dave Goulson highlights the critical role insects play in our ecosystems and their alarming rates of decline. Through scientific thoroughness and accessible writing, Goulson makes a strong case for why we need to pay attention to the plight of insects. His candid approach to discussing the grim reality of biodiversity loss is refreshing and disheartening, but the dry humour peppered throughout the book and insect facts interspersed between chapters helps to break the tension. Goulson divides his book into five parts – he explores the origins and significance of insects, provides evidence of declines, lists potential reasons for these declines, imagines a world without insects, and finally suggests mitigation strategies.\nIn part one, Goulson explores the fascinating world of insects, tracing their evolution and highlighting their importance and inherent value. He emphasizes the critical ecosystem services provided, including pollination, decomposition, and pest control. This section underscores the sheer diversity and biomass of insects, establishing a strong foundation for understanding their indispensable role in maintaining ecological balance.\nGoulson then presents evidence of the widespread decline of insect populations. He acknowledges the paucity of research in this field and the limitations inherent in many studies. Despite these hurdles, the trends of insect declines are unmistakable. Goulson’s intellectual honesty and vulnerability stands out as he admits that even he is “not absolutely certain where the truth lies”. Goulson highlights the critical issue of “shifting baselines,” where each generation perceives a progressively degraded environment as the new normal. He broadens the scope beyond insects to address the overall loss of biodiversity, driving home the point that the decline of insects is part of a larger ecological crisis. This section is sobering as it stresses the urgent need for reliable research.\nThe third part delves into the multifaceted causes of insect declines. Goulson systematically examines the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation, pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides, fertilisers, invasive species (plants and animals) and their associated dangers, and climate change. He argues these factors likely compound into a “death by a thousand cuts”, with industrial agriculture as the undeniable driving force. Goulson’s alarming rhetoric acts as a wake-up call, reproaching agrichemical companies’ manipulation of research and advocating for precaution in future environmental management practices. Goulson’s exhortation that “we are committing ecocide on a biblical scale” cuts through niceties with a sobering call for immediate action and precaution.\nIn the fourth part, Goulson imagines a world devoid of insects (post-apocalypse), painting a harrowing picture of the future. This speculative scenario is the most emotionally charged section of the book, designed to shock readers into realizing the potential consequences of inaction. Goulson’s vivid descriptions of environmental and economic collapse and compelling narrative make this section a visceral and haunting reminder of what is at stake.\nAfter sounding the alarm bells, the concluding section wisely prescribes solutions: public awareness, urban greening, engaging youth, and sustainable agricultural practices that are echoed across many conservation books. Although there are some suggestions addressing governing bodies, this section falls short in truly addressing systemic issues and the need for broader political and corporate engagement.\nGoulson’s honesty about the situation at hand, coupled with his clear communication of the science, makes this book an essential read for anyone concerned about the environment. However, his emphasis on solutions within the UK (global north) and the lack of focus on how to engage big corporations and government officials are notable shortcomings. Despite these issues, Silent Earth is a powerful wake-up call that stresses the urgent need for action to prevent an ecological catastrophe.",

    "title": "Life Changing - Helen Pilcher",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In “Life Changing: How Humans are Shaping the Course of Evolution”, Helen Pilcher explores how humans have fundamentally altered life on Earth. In this book, Pilcher argues that “Life is changing. Humans are responsible”. Her guide on the ‘post-natural’ history of our world showcases, in three parts, how we shape our surroundings: how we have unwittingly advanced some species, how we purposefully tailor species to our wants and needs, and finally, how we can harness this knowledge to assist conservation efforts. Pilcher discusses these themes with a strong focus on genetics and evolution. She supports her argument through tackling concepts such as genetic modification and assisted evolution by discussing broad topics like domestication, selective breeding, artificial insemination, cloning, de-extinction, hybridisation, and rewilding.\nAs a former scientific reporter with a PhD in stem cell biology, Pilcher understands the importance of both communicating science accurately and correcting false beliefs. As a former stand-up comedian, she also understands the importance of making difficult content relatable through quick wit and an occasional acerbic joke. She immediately establishes this as a concrete idea that ancient domestication of animals and plants is a form of genetic modification, albeit distinct from modern, laboratory-based methods in degree rather than kind – she says about her dog or ‘genetically modified wolf’ that “The result is an animal so far removed from its original wild form that he barks at bin bags and often refuses to go out in the rain”. Pilcher also corrects common misbeliefs surrounding cloning – clarifying that it does not produce an exact genetic replica but rather an “identical twin”,  illustrating her point by comparing the difference in scrotal circumference of two clones – the “prolific beef sires” (Final Answer and Final Answer II). Furthermore, she amends the notion of de-extinction as resurrection by explaining that it involves modifying a closely related species to resemble its extinct ancestor, describing them as a “hybrid modern-day facsimile”.\nPilcher deftly communicates her viewpoints while acknowledging opposing beliefs and even potential benefits to some practices with which she may disagree. She subtly hints at issues surrounding overpopulation and excessive meat consumption without being accusatory or condescending. She approaches depressing topics such as animal suffering and climate change with a determined optimism and offers silver-lined solutions. While Pilcher’s bias toward rewilding is evident in her abundant praise, she could have more fully explained the controversy and debate surrounding the topic. In this area, mentioning a more integrated approach combining rewilding efforts with regenerative farming practices and reduced meat consumption could have provided a more balanced perspective on creating healthier agricultural systems, rather than relying mainly on rewilding.\n“Life Changing” stands out among others in this genre concerning altered species, genetics, evolution, and climate change. Pilcher’s extensive understanding and thorough research, coupled with her wicked sense of humour, allow readers to grasp even the most complex subjects with ease. From the outset, it’s clear that Pilcher possesses a rare talent for communicating nuanced ideas with clarity and wit in an unbiased manner. She guides the reader through each topic with an intuitive flow, gradually building understanding and solidifying concepts with excellently timed quips.\n“Life Changing” presents a solid foundation for understanding how we influence the genetic make-up and evolution of other species, as well as our overall impact on the world. While not an exhaustive text, it offers insight into our past influences and provides suggestions on how to proceed responsibly moving forward. Accessible enough for the uninitiated dilettante yet profound enough for the specialist savant, this book broadens intellectual horizons across the spectrum. Pilcher’s engaging writing style delivered a must-read to those looking to expand their knowledge or those wanting a casual read.",
