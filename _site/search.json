Itâ€™s easy to realise our insignificance when facing a gentle giant. I am curious about whale and shark behaviour, communication, distribution, and genetics. I am interested in how climate change is altering nature and how nature is evolving in spite of it. I am interested in humans and how they interact with the world around them."
