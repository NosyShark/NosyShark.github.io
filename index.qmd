title: "Nosy Whale"
---

My name is Emma Swanepoel. I am a biologist in my honours year at the University of Cape Town.

I am interested in marine megafauna. It's easy to realise our insignificance when facing a gentle giant. I am curious about whale and shark behaviour, communication, distribution, and genetics. I am interested in how climate change is altering nature and how nature is evolving in response to climate change. I am interested in humans and how they interact with the world around them. hhhhhh
