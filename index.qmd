Hi, my name is Emm. I am a biologist doing my Masters at the University of Cape Town.

I am a big nerd for marine megafauna. It's easy to realise our insignificance when facing a gentle giant. I am interested in whale and shark behaviour, communication, distribution, and genetics. I am obsessed with how climate change is altering nature and how nature is evolving because of it. I am interested in humans and how they interact with the world around them.

Disclaimer: I am a biologist - not a developer. This website is janky while I figure shit out.
