Hi, my name is Emma. I am a biologist in my honours year at the University of Cape Town.

I am a big nerd for marine megafauna. It's easy to realise our insignificance when facing a gentle giant. I am interested in whale and shark behaviour, communication, distribution, and genetics. I am obsessed with how climate change is altering nature and how nature is evolving because of it. I am interested in humans and how they interact with the world around them.

For now this website will be dedicated to getting better at coding in R. So it'll likely be code and some GIS visuals for projects. Hopefully a link to a publication sometime next year.
