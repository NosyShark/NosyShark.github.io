title: "Nosy Whale"

My name is Emma. I am a biologist in my honours year at the University of Cape Town.

I am curious about marine megafauna. It's easy to realise our insignificance when facing a gentle giant. I am interested in whale and shark behaviour, communication, distribution, and genetics. I am interested in how climate change is altering nature and how nature is evolving because of and it. I am interested in humans and how they interact with the world around them.

For now this website will be dedicated to getting better at coding. So it'll likely be code and some GIS visuals for projects. Hopefully a link to a publication sometime next year.
