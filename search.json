    "title": "Silent Earth: Averting the Insect Apocalypse - Dave Goulson",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Silent Earth is a compelling and urgent call to action. In it, biologist Dave Goulson highlights the critical role insects play in our ecosystems and their alarming rates of decline. Through scientific thoroughness and accessible writing, Goulson makes a strong case for why we need to pay attention to the plight of insects. His candid approach to discussing the grim reality of biodiversity loss is refreshing and disheartening, but the dry humour peppered throughout the book and insect facts interspersed between chapters helps to break the tension. Goulson divides his book into five parts – he explores the origins and significance of insects, provides evidence of declines, lists potential reasons for these declines, imagines a world without insects, and finally suggests mitigation strategies.\nIn part one, Goulson explores the fascinating world of insects, tracing their evolution and highlighting their importance and inherent value. He emphasizes the critical ecosystem services provided, including pollination, decomposition, and pest control. This section underscores the sheer diversity and biomass of insects, establishing a strong foundation for understanding their indispensable role in maintaining ecological balance.\nGoulson then presents evidence of the widespread decline of insect populations. He acknowledges the paucity of research in this field and the limitations inherent in many studies. Despite these hurdles, the trends of insect declines are unmistakable. Goulson’s intellectual honesty and vulnerability stands out as he admits that even he is “not absolutely certain where the truth lies”. Goulson highlights the critical issue of “shifting baselines,” where each generation perceives a progressively degraded environment as the new normal. He broadens the scope beyond insects to address the overall loss of biodiversity, driving home the point that the decline of insects is part of a larger ecological crisis. This section is sobering as it stresses the urgent need for reliable research.\nThe third part delves into the multifaceted causes of insect declines. Goulson systematically examines the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation, pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides, fertilisers, invasive species (plants and animals) and their associated dangers, and climate change. He argues these factors likely compound into a “death by a thousand cuts”, with industrial agriculture as the undeniable driving force. Goulson’s alarming rhetoric acts as a wake-up call, reproaching agrichemical companies’ manipulation of research and advocating for precaution in future environmental management practices. Goulson’s exhortation that “we are committing ecocide on a biblical scale” cuts through niceties with a sobering call for immediate action and precaution.\nIn the fourth part, Goulson imagines a world devoid of insects (post-apocalypse), painting a harrowing picture of the future. This speculative scenario is the most emotionally charged section of the book, designed to shock readers into realizing the potential consequences of inaction. Goulson’s vivid descriptions of environmental and economic collapse and compelling narrative make this section a visceral and haunting reminder of what is at stake.\nAfter sounding the alarm bells, the concluding section wisely prescribes solutions: public awareness, urban greening, engaging youth, and sustainable agricultural practices that are echoed across many conservation books. Although there are some suggestions addressing governing bodies, this section falls short in truly addressing systemic issues and the need for broader political and corporate engagement.\nGoulson’s honesty about the situation at hand, coupled with his clear communication of the science, makes this book an essential read for anyone concerned about the environment. However, his emphasis on solutions within the UK (global north) and the lack of focus on how to engage big corporations and government officials are notable shortcomings. Despite these issues, Silent Earth is a powerful wake-up call that stresses the urgent need for action to prevent an ecological catastrophe.\n\n\n\nCover of Silent Earth by Dave Goulson",

    "title": "Life Changing - Helen Pilcher",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In “Life Changing: How Humans are Shaping the Course of Evolution”, Helen Pilcher explores how humans have fundamentally altered life on Earth. In this book, Pilcher argues that “Life is changing. Humans are responsible”. Her guide on the ‘post-natural’ history of our world showcases, in three parts, how we shape our surroundings: how we have unwittingly advanced some species, how we purposefully tailor species to our wants and needs, and finally, how we can harness this knowledge to assist conservation efforts. Pilcher discusses these themes with a strong focus on genetics and evolution. She supports her argument through tackling concepts such as genetic modification and assisted evolution by discussing broad topics like domestication, selective breeding, artificial insemination, cloning, de-extinction, hybridisation, and rewilding.\nAs a former scientific reporter with a PhD in stem cell biology, Pilcher understands the importance of both communicating science accurately and correcting false beliefs. As a former stand-up comedian, she also understands the importance of making difficult content relatable through quick wit and an occasional acerbic joke. She immediately establishes this as a concrete idea that ancient domestication of animals and plants is a form of genetic modification, albeit distinct from modern, laboratory-based methods in degree rather than kind – she says about her dog or ‘genetically modified wolf’ that “The result is an animal so far removed from its original wild form that he barks at bin bags and often refuses to go out in the rain”. Pilcher also corrects common misbeliefs surrounding cloning – clarifying that it does not produce an exact genetic replica but rather an “identical twin”,  illustrating her point by comparing the difference in scrotal circumference of two clones – the “prolific beef sires” (Final Answer and Final Answer II). Furthermore, she amends the notion of de-extinction as resurrection by explaining that it involves modifying a closely related species to resemble its extinct ancestor, describing them as a “hybrid modern-day facsimile”.\nPilcher deftly communicates her viewpoints while acknowledging opposing beliefs and even potential benefits to some practices with which she may disagree. She subtly hints at issues surrounding overpopulation and excessive meat consumption without being accusatory or condescending. She approaches depressing topics such as animal suffering and climate change with a determined optimism and offers silver-lined solutions. While Pilcher’s bias toward rewilding is evident in her abundant praise, she could have more fully explained the controversy and debate surrounding the topic. In this area, mentioning a more integrated approach combining rewilding efforts with regenerative farming practices and reduced meat consumption could have provided a more balanced perspective on creating healthier agricultural systems, rather than relying mainly on rewilding.\n“Life Changing” stands out among others in this genre concerning altered species, genetics, evolution, and climate change. Pilcher’s extensive understanding and thorough research, coupled with her wicked sense of humour, allow readers to grasp even the most complex subjects with ease. From the outset, it’s clear that Pilcher possesses a rare talent for communicating nuanced ideas with clarity and wit in an unbiased manner. She guides the reader through each topic with an intuitive flow, gradually building understanding and solidifying concepts with excellently timed quips.\n“Life Changing” presents a solid foundation for understanding how we influence the genetic make-up and evolution of other species, as well as our overall impact on the world. While not an exhaustive text, it offers insight into our past influences and provides suggestions on how to proceed responsibly moving forward. Accessible enough for the uninitiated dilettante yet profound enough for the specialist savant, this book broadens intellectual horizons across the spectrum. Pilcher’s engaging writing style delivered a must-read to those looking to expand their knowledge or those wanting a casual read.\n\n\n\nCover of Life Changing by Helen Pilcher",

It’s easy to realise our insignificance when facing a gentle giant. I am interested in whale and shark behaviour, communication, distribution, and genetics. I am obsessed with how climate change is altering nature and how nature is evolving because of it. I am interested in humans and how they interact with the world around them.\nDisclaimer: I am a biologist - not a developer. This website is janky while I figure shit out.",

    "text": "Southern Africa’s kelp forests, particularly around the Cape Peninsula, harbor a remarkable diversity of shark species, some of which are found nowhere else on Earth. Along rocky reefs and sandy flats, these cryptic hunters will wriggle their way into your hearts with their mesmerising patterns, interesting hunting techniques, and endearing defense mechanisms.\n\nThe Shysharks\nThis genus of shark - Haploblepharus - are named for their charming defensive behaviour. When threatened, they curl into circles and cover their eyes with their tails. This genus includes four species: Puffadder shysharks, H. edwardsii, or “Happy Eddies”; Dark shysharks, H. pictus; Brown shysharks, H. fuscus; Natal shyshark, H. kristnasanyi (not included because they are data deficient on iNat). Shysharks are oviparous, laying eggs in tough capsules attached to rocks or kelp. They’re nocturnal hunters that rest during the day, often piled togethre in caves with their heads tucked in crevices.\n\n\nThe Poroderma Catsharks\nThe genus Poroderma includes two diver favourite sharks. Spotting their iconic patterns slipping through sea bamboo (Ecklonia maxima) is such a treat. The pyjama shark (P. africanum) is instantly recognisable by it’s bold dark striped over a light grey body and gained notoriety through “My Octopus Teacher” where it starred as the villain (as sharks often do). Similar to the shysharks, they can be found sleeping in the day piled on top of each other in cracks between rocks or nestled in dark corners of shipwrecks and old pipes. At night they emerge to hunt octopuses, lobsters, crabs, and fish. The leopard catshark (P. pantherinum) is the pyjama shark’s smaller, more elusive cousin sporting dark rosettes instead of striped (though some individuals’ rosettes merge to create dark streaks). Leopard catsharks are more cryptic, preferring tight cracks and crevices, making them harder to spot (pun intended).\n\n\nThe Izak Catsharks\nHolohalaelurus (nicknamed hallelujah sharks) are deep-dwelling (100 - 400 m) catsharks characterised by broad, flattened heads and ornate patterns. The Izak catshark, H. regani, is the most abundant along the Southern African coastline. Despite being regularly caught as bycatch in hake trawl fisheries, populations have been increasing (rare among commercially impacted sharks). The African spotted catshark (white-spotted Izak), H. punctatus, is a small dwarf catshark that uses a unique sidewinding locomotory technique to capture prey. Unfortunately this species has suffered a dramatic decline, representing an estimated 50 to 79% population decline. The honeycomb Izak or Natal Izak, H. favus, hasn’t been seen since the mid-1970s despite intensive research efforts, suggesting it may be critically endangered or extinct. Unfortunately I had to leave these out of the maps as there were no observations on iNaturalist (c’mon fishermen - join the fun!).\n\n\nOther Benthic Catsharks\nThe yellow-spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus capensis, is aptly named as it is covered in small golden-yellow spots over light grey and dark saddle patches. These nocturnal predators frequent rocky reefs and sandy bottoms but face pressure as bycatch in hake fisheries and are considered Near Threatened by the IUCN. The tiger catshark, Halaelurus natalensis, have dark dorsal saddles creating stripes resembling tigers - or so the people who named them say - and distinctive upturned snouts. They are endemic to Southern Africa, but face a population decline of 30 - 49% due to trawling pressure.\n\n\nThe Spotted Gully Shark\nAlso known as the sharptooth houndshark, Triakis megalopterus, have exceptionally long fins that provide stability and agility for maneuvering along the seafloor. They often form large aggregations during breeding seasons, particularly in False Bay. Despite their size (reaching up to 2 m), they fall prey to sevengill sharks and face vulnerability to overfishing and slow growth rates.\n\n\nThe Broadnose Sevengill Shark\nThese sharks, Notorynchus cepedianus, resemble ancient sharks (we’re talking older than trees here) and have a lineage dating back 1 million years (the mid-Pleistocene). Their old roots can be seen in the number of gill slits they have - 7 where most sharks have 5 - and their lacking dorsal fin. They hunt seals, fish, squids, rays, and other sharks and have been observed using cooperative hunting tactics. They are silver-grey to brown with scattered black and white spots, and can reach 3 m in length. Though once common in False Bay waters (especially around Miller’s Point), they are now a rare sight to see. The reason for their decline is uncertain but has been impacted - similarly to the white sharks - by the predation of Cape Town’s visiting orcas Port and Starboard (named for their floppy dorsal fins falling left and right respectively).\nThis is a distributional map of some cool sharks around the coast of Southern Africa (and the Southern Hemisphere - in the case of sevengill sharks).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnywho - thank you for sticking with me through this! As a reward here’s a little picture of a shyshark I took a while back.\n\nHappy Eddy - ‘Haploblepharus edwardsii’ - photographed at Windmill Beach, Cape Town.\nOkay - SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH!!\nThank you Jasper Slingsby for providing the base code for this.
